    "- If `mamba install pyscf` fails, try switching to a Python 3.9 runtime or run the ab-initio steps on a full conda VM/WSL where conda-forge is reliable.\n",
    "- If `pip install pyscf` fails, it likely attempted a source build (missing Fortran/BLAS). Use the condacolab flow instead.\n",
    "- For quick algorithm development you can run the repository's precomputed fallback (fast) and later regenerate the Hamiltonian on a stronger machine. See the repo `README.md` for details.\n",
